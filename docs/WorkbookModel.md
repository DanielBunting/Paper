The workbook model, is a sub-property of the user. 

There will be a collection of Wokbooks. 

These each have a collection of pages. 

We can add, remove, insert pages and manage all of this stuff

Pages could have certain things set - say colour outline or similar, ordering, section etc. 
We will figure out all of these options, and implement them individually.  

There will be two types of page, Static and Dynamic, Dynamic can go from Horizontal to Vertical, re-arranging the tabs, 
If they're non-dynamic, the pages will have the details of the brush stroke on top. If they're dynamic, there is sections that are able to be written to.
